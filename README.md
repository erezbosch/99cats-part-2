# 99 Cats Part 2: The color scheme isn't insanely good anymore

It's a cat rental Rails app. With authentication. Features:

* You need to be logged in to create a cat or a rental request
* You can't edit a cat unless you are its owner (i.e. you created it)
* You can't approve or deny a pending rental request unless you own the requested cat
* You can log in via multiple devices, browsers, etc., at a time, and when you log out of one you will still be logged in on the others
* The site will tell you your geographical location (doesn't work on local hosting) and which browser you used to access the site

My partner for this work was Cindy van Dooren.
